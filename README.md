# WTiS

This repository contains C/C++ code for NodeMCU, Teensy 3.6, and ATTiny85 microcontrollers, and Max/MSP patches and accompanying Javascript and Python code.

Some device documentation assumes access to device prototypes used in the 2019 WTiS run at the Tribecca Film Festival. 

See the README files in `Devices` and `StateMachine` for detailed documentation.
